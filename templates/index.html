<h1>Welcome to RecipEASE</h1>
<p>
RecipEASE is your one stop shop for your recipes, items you have in your food pantry, and a 
shopping list of the items you still need.
</p>
<p>
After entering your recipes, you will be able to choose your menu for the week/2 weeks/month.  Your 
shopping list will be created based off what you need for your recipe and what you already have in 
your pantry.
</p>
<p>
For easy entry, use the Pantry Scanner for automatic entry or enter your pantry items manually.
</p>
<p>
Also, for each item in your pantry you can set a minimum amount.  Once you use those items in your menu, 
your pantry will update.  Once you reach below the minimum amount, that item will be added to your shopping 
list.
